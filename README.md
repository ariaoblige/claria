# claria
Windows Command Prompt lacks a lot of quite useful functionalities seen in PowerShell or Bash. Something as simple as creating files in Command Prompt requires using a command not meant for doing so. Claria makes it easier by introducing commands such as `aria create` or `aria list`.
It's also worth noting that it is not restricted to Windows Command Prompt, but it won't add much to anything other than cmd since most alternatives already include functionalities equivalent to the ones present in Claria.
